## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi there! I'm Kajal — a passionate and results-driven software engineer with over 6 years of experience in Java development and full-stack software engineering. I've worked across dynamic teams, from innovative robotics backends at Wandelbots GmbH to enterprise authentication systems at H&R Block.

Recently completed Master’s in Applied Computer Science at TH Deggendorf, I specialize in building robust microservices, optimizing backend architectures, and delivering scalable digital solutions. I’m also exploring machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through academic research at Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co. KG.
